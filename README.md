~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Mod Info~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

With the information we got from the gigaleak, it confirmed that Master Quest was indeed the final version of the Disk Expansion meant for Ocarina of Time or Ura Zelda as most fans have come to know it by. It was never more than a dungeon replacement due to coding limitations. However upon digging further into the files, we have found the original DD layouts that Master Quest based itself upon. While most of the original DD layouts were available, there was a couple that were never completed. We merged Ice Cavern with its MQ counterpart since it was almost exactly the same and the Bottom of the well was empty with a few left over actors from normal OoT so we ported it's MQ variant over. Ganon's castle was never planned for the Disk Expansion which was confirmed in the gigaleak files and the 64DD OVL file. But since Nintendo later added it as a bonus dungeon when they made MQ we decided to add it as a way of giving a sense of completion to the mod. We do hope you enjoy these new challenging dungeons! Just a word of caution, make sure that you get items, songs, etc as soon as you are able to because these DD dungeons do make use of everything.



~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Instructions~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Please download the appropriate patch files required! You will need to provide
your own clean backup copy of Ocarina of Time 1.0 of either the US version or the Japanese version(Big Endian). It does not need to be decompressed. (PAL not supported)

Download beat from https://www.romhacking.net/utilities/893/

Open Beat.exe and click "Apply Patch", then it will allow you to choose the patch either ZeldaDDE.bps or ZeldaDDJ.bps. Afterwards, choose the clean backup copy of 1.0 and then name the rom. Make sure to keep the same file extention as your rom(.z64).

If you done everything correctly, the patcher will say patching was successful!

-Increased text speed as 1.0 text speed is nortoriously slow
-Fixed developer oversights such as broken flags/checks, missing objects, text spacing errors, etc
-Ported over treasure chest icons for working maps
-Ported Bottom of the Well and Ganon's Castle over from MQ
-Merged DD Ice Cavern with MQ variant

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Excluded files~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Anything relating to the DD test dungeon files that everyone keeps calling boss rush modes.(That's why some of them are labled ddtes{DD test}) OoT's DD abilities are very limited, it could not support having a boss rush mode without it getting very hacky and none of the files relating to building the expansion even points to these files, including Z2_ReDead and Z2_DD_IKE. Z2 has been used in all Majora's Mask maps and most likely is beta related to Zelda Gaidan.
